A text hotline which empowers those with information easily obtainable with smartphones.

The hotline will support various tasks such as:

- Supplying walking, driving, and public transportation directions between destinations.
- Information of homeless shelters and food kitchens.
- Send alerts and important information to users.
- Locations of public bathrooms and other facilities.

A stretch goal for this project is to incorporate other languages, primarily Spanish or Chinese.
